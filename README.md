# Course on Neural Networks
This is a beginners course on neural network for Cogito NTNU's spring semester start.

In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn the fundamentals of neural networks through practical experience with the Red vine quality dataset. By the end of the session, you will be able to:
* Understand the basic concepts of machine learning.
* Create and train a neural network in Python with pytorch.
* Apply machine learning algorithms to real-world data.
* Evaluate the performance of Neural networks.
* Collaborate with a team to solve machine learning problems.


## Prerequisites
* Ensure that git is installed on your machine. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended) [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CogitoNTNU/course-on-neural-networks.git
```
2. Install juptyer notebook
```bash
pip install ipykernel -U --user
```

## How to Use This Notebook
Follow the parts in order, completing tasks and exercises as you go.
Experiment with the code cells to reinforce your learning.
