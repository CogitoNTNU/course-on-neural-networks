# Neural-Network-Course
This is a basic neural network course for Cogito NTNU's spring semester start.

2 hours


## Intro (20 min)
* Thanks for comming. 
* What are we supposed to learn?
* Why is this useful?
    - Knowing network structure and basics allow you to make 
    your own or adapt networks to different task


### What is Machine Learning and how do neural networks fit in?

Mimic human neurons
How are they connected?

#### Math 

Matrices and activation function

## How to create and use a Neural Network? (Sverre)

We show a simple example network in pytorch and explain line by line
Create a class with methods init and forward

Task:
Create a network with our specifications


## How to do an prediction
We show how to do the prediction
pytorch

## Loss Functions and Optimization
* Common loss functions (cross-entropy, MSE).
* The gradient descent concept.
* Introduction to backpropagation (high-level explanation).

## Competition
Given a dataset try to create the best neural network for it
